== Install Pre-Requisites

We need "pyautogui" which has an installation guide for various platforms here:

http://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

For Kali Linux, the required commands were:

pip install python3-xlib
apt-get install scrot python3-dev
pip install pyautogui

Any problems installing pyautogui then refer to their documentation for your OS.

Additionally we need this for the sexy progress update bar:

pip install tqdm

Finally, this for sound:

pip install playsound
